## Smart Contract ABI

The frontend is configured to work with a smart contract that includes the following functions:

- `deposit(uint256 periodSeconds)` - Deposit ETH for a specified period
- `withdraw()` - Withdraw locked funds after deadline
- `balanceOf(address user)` - Get user's locked balance
- `deadlineOf(address user)` - Get user's withdrawal deadline
- `locks(address user)` - Get complete lock information

## Usage

1. **Connect Wallet**: Click "Connect Wallet" to connect your MetaMask or other Web3 wallet
2. **Deposit**: Enter an amount in ETH and select a lock period (7-365 days)
3. **Wait**: Your funds are locked until the deadline
4. **Withdraw**: After the deadline passes, you can withdraw your funds
